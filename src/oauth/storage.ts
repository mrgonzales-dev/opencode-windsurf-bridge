/**
 * On-disk credential storage for the OAuth flow.
 *
 * Path: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode-windsurf-auth/credentials.json` —
 * verified that on the actual `xdg-basedir` package, `xdgConfig` resolves
 * to `~/.config/opencode-windsurf-auth` on Linux AND macOS (the package
 * doesn't follow the Cocoa "Library/Application Support" convention even
 * on macOS). Windows falls through to `~/.config` via our manual fallback
 * since xdgConfig is undefined there.
 *
 * We deliberately store on disk (mode 0600) rather than in the OS keychain
 * because:
 *   1. We need a *cross-process* token — opencode invokes the plugin in many
 *      short-lived Node subprocesses, and Keychain prompts every time would be
 *      unusable.
 *   2. The token grants Cascade chat access but doesn't unlock anything else
 *      on the user's machine; chmod 0600 is the same risk envelope as
 *      `~/.codeium/config.json` (Codeium plugins' own storage choice).
 *
 * We previously used `proper-lockfile` for cross-process locking, but its
 * CJS/ESM interop blew up in opencode's Bun runtime
 * (`(await getLockfile()).lock is not a function` — `mod.default` resolves to
 * the namespace object, not the callable). For a single-user OAuth flow we
 * don't actually need cross-process locking; `O_EXCL` lockfile + atomic
 * tmp-rename gives us identical safety without the dependency.

 *      a handful of times before giving up.
 *   2. Write the payload to a process-scoped tmp file (`credentials.json.<pid>.tmp`).
 *   3. `rename()` is atomic on POSIX — the reader either sees the OLD file
 *      or the FULLY-WRITTEN new file, never a half-written one.
 *   4. Always unlink the lockfile on the way out.
 *
 * Stale-lock guard: if the existing lockfile is older than 30s, we assume the
